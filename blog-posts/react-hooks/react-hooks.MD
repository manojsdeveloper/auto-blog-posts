1. State management in a React app
1. Traditional approach of managing state
1. Replacing traditional state management with React Hooks

## Part 1: React Hooks - the what, why and how?

### What are hooks?

Hook is a function that lets you access state without using a class component. 
Hooks are a more natural way of thinking about React. Instead of thinking of what lifecycle methods to use, you can now write components thinking of how your data neeeds to be used. 


React hooks were introduced in October 2018 and released in February 2019.
It is now available with React 16.8 and higher. React hooks became hugely popular as soon as it was introduced.

### What makes react hooks so popular? 
1. Cleaner code.
2. No need to use class components to use state.
3. No need to think of how React lifecycle but think of application data. 

What I love about hooks is that it lets you use react state even in a functional component which wasnâ€™t possible before react 16.8. Traditionally, if you had a functional component and you wanted to add state to it, you would have to convert it into a class component.

### The 4 golden hooks

#### 1. useState

useState is used to set and update state like `this.state` in a class component.

```
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState); 
```

#### 2. useEffect

useEffect is used to carry out a function that does side effects. Side effects could include things like DOM manipulation, subscriptions and API calls.

``` 
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = 'New Title' 
});

```


#### 3. useReducer

useReducer works similar to how a reducer works in Redux if you are familiar with it. useReducer is used when state is more complex.

```
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init);
```

#### 4. useContext
useContext is similar to Context API. In context API, there is a provider method and consumer method. Similarly, with useContext, the closest provider method is used to read data.

```
const value = useContext(MyContext);
```
For more detailed explanation of how each of these work, read [the official docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate)


## Part 2 How to use hooks for state management?

With React 16.8, you can use Hooks out of the box.

We are going to build an application to make a list of songs. Here is what it will do - 

1.  Render a list of songs if any from the API. 
2. Have an ability to add a song to the list. 
3. When the song gets added to the list, update the list on the frontend and data store on the backend. 

Btw, all the code is available on [my github](https://github.com/shrutikapoor08/hooks-graphql).
To see this in action, you can go to [this codesandbox](tinyurl.com/hooksgql)

We are going to use GraphQL with this app. Here are the steps we will do to setup state management using hooks - 

1. Setup context. 
Initialize your state. Call this `initialState`

1. Call `useReducer` with the `initialState`.
1. Figure out which top level component should have `context` and setup `context`.
1. Pass in the `dispatch` returned from `useReducer` to the Context provider API so that children have access to `dispatch`. 
1. Hook up Graphql API to a component using `useEffect`. 
1. Use `useContext` and `useReducer` to receive and update global application state. 
1. Use `useState` for local state.
